<h3>Build process</h3>

<p>
	First you have to choose the distro name, provide a short description,
	and a valid email address so Pizza can notify you when ISOs are built or
	in case the build failed. You must also choose a skeleton to base your
	custom distro on. Then add some packages and follow the steps. When
	validating the build, Pizza will create a tarball of your flavors and add
	it to the build queue so that the tarball file can be directly downloaded. 
	When your flavor is built you will get a mail, it will be displayed on the 
	Pizza main page and on the RSS feed.
