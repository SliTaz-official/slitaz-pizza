<ul>
	<li>How long does it take to build ?
		<p>By default Pizza builds a distro every 15 mins but skips a run if 
		another distro is still building. Then it all depends on the build queue
		and the size of your custom SliTaz distro.</p>

	<li>How long will you keep my ISO ?
		<p>We can't guarantee hosting it for a long time, but we will keep
		your product for as long as we can. But with enough time for you to share it
		with your friends or family.</p>
