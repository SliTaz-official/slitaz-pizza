<ul>
	<li>Is it long to build ?
		<p>By default Pizza builds a distro every 15 min but skips a run if 
		another distro is still building. After it depends on the build queue,
		and the size of your custom SliTaz distro.</p>

	<li>How long do you keep my ISO ?
		<p>We can't guarantee hosting for a long time actually, we will keep
		your product as long as we can. But surely enough time to share it
		with your friends or family.</p>
