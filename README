Build process
-------------
First you have to choose the distro name, provide a short description,
a valid email address so Pizza can notify you when ISO is built or in
case the build failed. You must also choose a skeleton to base your
custom distro on. Then add some packages and follow the steps. When
validate the build, Pizza will create a tarball of your flavors a add
it to the build queue, so it can take some time before your ISO image
is generated.


FAQ
---

	* Is it long to build ?
    
	  By default Pizza build a distro each 20 min but skip a run if an
	  other distro is still building. After it depend on the build queue,
	  and the size of your custom SliTaz distro.

	* How long do you keep my ISO ?
	
	  We can't garanty hosting for long time actually, we will keep your
	  product as long as wee can. But surely enough time to share it with
	  your friends or family.



Installation and Administration
-------------------------------
Pizza use a chroot to build ISO and a web interface to create the flavor
file. Pizza can be installed and setup in a few commands. The package provide
pizza host utility, pizza-bot build bot for chroot and pizza.cgi wich is
the web interface main script. So let's go throught the installation:

# tazpkg -gi slitaz-pizza

Or from Hg:

# hg clone http://hg.slitaz.org/slitaz-pizza
# cd pizza && make install

You can display a list of command an a short usage with the usage command.
Create the chroot and build environment. You may want to have a look
at Pizza configuration file before processing:

# pizza setup

Now you ready to start the build bot to build queued flavors one by one.
You can also chroot in the environment to build manually or test.

# pizza start

In time they may be quiet a lot of ISO and temporary files. To clean up the
temporary files and old flavors files:

# pizza purge

The cron task is run in the chroot and check if any flavor have been submited,
by default it check all 20 minutes. The bot frenquency can be changed by
editing root crontabs in the build chroot.

To check build queue or chroot manually your can use:

# pizza exec pizza-bot
# pizza chroot


Developers and translators
--------------------------
SHell script as you could expected. Keep speed in mind and security. Always
think to have a simple option and a advanced option, for example in rootfs
modification let users add custom wallpaper easely and advanced users can
upload a full roootfs.

Pizza has been coded from the beginning with gettext support. Please forget
'echo' and use gettext, but remember that gettext "" is equivalent to echo -n.
To start a new translation please use msginit from the pot file directory.
Example for French/France locale (fr_FR):

	$ msginit -l fr_FR -o fr.po -i pizza.pot
