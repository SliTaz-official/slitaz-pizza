Installation and Administration
-------------------------------
Pizza uses a chroot to build ISOs and a web interface to create the flavor
file. Pizza can be installed and setup in a few commands. The package provides
a pizza host utility, pizza-bot build bot for chroot and pizza.cgi which is
the web interface main script. So let's go through the installation:

# tazpkg -gi slitaz-pizza

Or from Hg:

# hg clone http://hg.slitaz.org/slitaz-pizza
# cd pizza && make install

You can display a list of commands and a short usage with the usage command.
Create the chroot and build environment. You may want to have a look
at the Pizza configuration file before processing:

# pizza setup

Now you are ready to start the build bot to build queued flavors one by one.
You can also chroot in the environment to build manually or test.

# pizza start

In time there may be quite a lot of ISOs and temporary files. To clean up the
temporary files and old flavors files:

# pizza purge

The cron task is run in the chroot and checks if any flavors have been submitted,
by default it checks every 20 minutes. The bot frequency can be changed by
editing root crontabs in the build chroot.

To check build queue or chroot manually you can use:

# pizza exec pizza-bot
# pizza chroot


Developers and translators
--------------------------
SHell script as you would expect. Keep speed in mind and security. Always
think to have a simple option and an advanced option, for example in rootfs
modification let users add custom wallpaper easily and advanced users can
upload a full roootfs.

Pizza has been coded from the beginning with gettext support. Please forget
'echo' and use gettext, but remember that gettext "" is equivalent to echo -n.
To start a new translation please use msginit from the pot file directory.
Example for French/France locale (fr_FR):

	$ msginit -l fr_FR -o fr.po -i pizza.pot
